                <p>He is ambidextrous and can use both hands equally well.
                    He was a talented football player in high school and was recruited by several colleges.
                    He was involved in a controversy when his mother bought him a Hummer as a birthday gift before he entered the NBA draft.
                    He was the first black man on the cover of Vogue magazine in 2008.
                    He married his high school sweetheart, Savannah Brinson, in 2013.

                    He is a supporter of former President Barack Obama and campaigned for him in 2008 and 2012.
                    He has endorsements from several brands, such as Nike, Coca-Cola, Beats by Dre, and Blaze Pizza.

                <p>One of the most distinctive features of Kawhi Leonard’s game is his enormous hands, which have earned him the nickname “The Claw.” But did you know that his hands didn’t always look like that? It was during his time in high school that Leonard’s hands began to develop their unique shape, with an exceptionally large palm and significantly long fingers. These unusual hands attribute to his incredible ability to steal the ball and make difficult shots.
